This project presents a compartmental model for simulating Human
papillomavirus (HPV) transmission in India, incorporating interventions
such as screening and Vaccination. The model aims to enhance our
understanding of HPV dynamics in the country, considering its diverse
population and healthcare challenges.

Key Features

-   Compartmental Model: This project utilizes a compartmental modelling
    approach to simulate HPV transmission within the Indian population.

-   Intervention Analysis: The model integrates screening and
    vaccination interventions, allowing for evaluation of their
    effectiveness in reducing HPV burden.

-   Optimal Control Theory: The project lays the groundwork for
    incorporating optimal control theory to identify the most
    cost-effective strategies for resource allocation in screening and
    vaccination programs.

Literature Review

A comprehensive review of existing HPV transmission models like HPVsim
and HPVadvise is included. This review provides context and highlights
the unique contributions of this project.

Results

-   Screening Model: We observed that screening effectively identifies
    and removes individuals from the early stages of HPV infection,
    thereby limiting the spread of the virus.

-   Vaccination Model: We observed that vaccination directly protects
    the individual. With a 95 per cent efficacy rate, the model reflects
    a significant decrease in the susceptible pool as more people become
    vaccinated, leading to a decline in infections.

-   Multi-Pronged Approach: The findings highlight the importance of
    combining screening and vaccination efforts for optimal cervical
    cancer prevention in India.

Future Work

-   Comprehensive Model Development: The project emphasizes the need for
    a comprehensive model integrating screening and vaccination to
    identify optimal intervention strategies.

-   Age-Structured and Gender-Specific Framework: Future refinements
    should incorporate an age-structured and potentially gender-specific
    framework to account for variations in HPV prevalence and sexual
    behaviour across demographics.

-   Optimal Control Theory Integration: Implementing optimal control
    theory within the comprehensive model will guide policymakers in
    optimizing resource allocation for maximizing cervical cancer
    prevention efforts.

Overall, this project provides valuable insights into HPV transmission
dynamics and the potential impact of interventions in the Indian
context. The groundwork laid for a future comprehensive model with
optimal control theory offers a powerful tool for informing public
health strategies and policy recommendations.
